The issue you're experiencing with the route /post/view/6546 returning a "not found" error is likely due to how you've defined your route handlers in the Routes method.

In your current implementation, you have:

go

mux.HandleFunc("/post/view", app.postView)

This route matches exactly /post/view, but does not account for additional segments in the URL, such as the post ID (/6546). To handle dynamic segments in your URLs, you need to modify the route to accommodate the variable part of the path.

You can do this by changing the route definition to include a parameter for the post ID:

go

mux.HandleFunc("/post/view/", app.postView)

And then, inside your postView handler, you can extract the post ID from the URL. Here's an example of how you can do that:

go

func (app *Application) postView(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    // Extract the post ID from the URL
    postID := r.URL.Path[len("/post/view/"):]

    // Now you can use postID (which would be "6546" in this case) for your logic
    // Example: Fetch the post from your database using the postID

    // Your handler logic here
}

Make sure to also handle the case where the post ID might not be a valid integer or might not correspond to an existing post in your database.

With these changes, accessing /post/view/6546 should now correctly route to your postView handler.
